#1. M. Mahmoudi and X. Zhou, Finding optimal solutions for vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery services with time windows: dynamic programming approach based on state-space-time network representation
> Method description: 
  state-space-time network construct, forward dynamics programming solution algorithm, Lagrangian relaxation approach, sub-gradient-based algorithm
> Model description:
  A directed graph and denoted as G(N,A), where N is the set of nodes, and A is the sets of links
    TT(i,j,t): each directed link (i,j) has time-dependent travel time from node i to node j starting at time t
    [a_p, b_p]: departure time window from passenger p's origin
    [a_p', b_p']: arrival time window from passenger p's destination
    o_v': dummy node for vehicle v's origin
    d_v': dummy node for vehicle v's destination
